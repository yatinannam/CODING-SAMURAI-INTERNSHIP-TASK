# Task 1 â€“ Chatbot with Rule-Based Logic

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To build a beginner-level chatbot using Python that can respond to basic user queries using rule-based logic.

## ðŸ§  Description

The chatbot simulates a help desk assistant that:
- Takes the user's name
- Matches keywords in user input to predefined categories
- Responds with appropriate messages using `if-elif-else` conditions
- Continues chatting until the user says 'bye', 'exit', or 'quit'

It handles four main query types:
- Product information  
- Technical support  
- Returns and refunds  
- General help

## ðŸ›  Skills Used

- Conditional statements  
- String manipulation (`.lower()`, `in`, `.strip()`)  
- Loops and user interaction  
- Randomized response selection

## Try sample inputs like:

- "Hi"
- "I need help with a product"
- "How do I return an item?"
- "I'm facing a problem"
- "Can you assist me?"
- "Bye"
