# Task 2 â€“ Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI

ðŸ“Œ **Objective**  
To build an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python where the computer uses the **Minimax algorithm** to play optimally against a human player.

---

ðŸ§  **Description**  
This project simulates a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game played between:
- A human (Player X)
- An AI opponent (Computer O)

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, allowing it to:
- Block the player's winning moves
- Choose the best possible outcome
- Never lose (only win or draw)

Key Features:
- Text-based game board in the terminal
- Player goes first, followed by AI
- Game ends when someone wins or itâ€™s a draw

---

ðŸ›  **Skills Used**
- Recursion and backtracking (Minimax algorithm)
- 2D board logic using 1D array
- Conditional statements
- Win/draw detection logic
- User input handling and validation
- Loops and game state management

---

ðŸŽ® **How to Play**
1. Run the program in terminal:
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe_minimax.py
